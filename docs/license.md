# Licensing

You will soon be able to buy a commercial license for MCUT from [CutDigital](https://cut-digital.com/contact/). The commercial offer is adapted to academic/research and industry customers. We offer flexible licensing options which are available for a wide range of applications and budgets. MCUT is licensed once for every product you make until the end of time. Our support options range from questions over email to bug-fixes and on-site visits (if deemed reasonable) from the actual authors of the code. Weâ€™re open to negotiating reasonable terms as well. We recognize that situations are unique, and we are prepared to tailor a license specifically to your needs. Contact [CutDigital](https://cut-digital.com/contact/) for further information. (At the moment, we only license to companies and academic institutions).
